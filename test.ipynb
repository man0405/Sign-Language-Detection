    "# Real-Time American Sign Language Detection and Speech Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a real-time Word-Level American Sign Language detection system with speech output. The system will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Capture video input from the webcam\n",
    "2. Detect hand gestures and classify them as ASL signs\n",
    "3. Convert recognized signs to text\n",
    "4. Synthesize speech from the recognized text\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses a modular approach with code organized into the following modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mediapipe_utils.py`: MediaPipe detection and landmark utilities\n",
    "- `data_processing.py`: Dataset creation and handling\n",
    "- `model_utils.py`: Model training and evaluation\n",
    "- `realtime_asl.py`: Real-time detection functionality\n",
    "- `sign_model_builder.py`: LSTM model architecture\n",
